        Theory of Everything is a generative artwork that attempts to use the animation of fundamental geometric shapes to portray the beauty of universal physical laws that our existence is based on. Combining still images and motions, Theory of Everything allows the audience to take part in the making of the art through implicit laws that were inspired by nature itself and experience the harmony of it in minimalist aesthetics.

        <i>Human-made rules are designed to be told and are expected to be followed. But the laws of nature are oftentimes quite the opposite. They are invisible, untouchable, and shall not be told to their creations, but challenge the living beings to explore the mechanism of everything by themselves. In order to do that, one will need the ability to see with not only their eyes but their logical thinking. This means only by thinking beyond human perception, which is all we, as humans, know by nature, can we see through the structures of everything we think we know, just like Isaac Newton saw the arms pulling all the apples to the center of the earth, Albert Einstein envisioned the relativity of every physical motion. 

<br>On a much smaller scale, Theory of Everything constructs a two-dimensional micro-universe with its own staticity and motion, as well as its fundamental laws. The basic geometric shapes take after how the two forms of being that construct nearly everything we know are usually imagined. It welcomes any curious audience to virtually touch this world and discover its laws behind the visual layer, witness its birth, death, and rebirth. Theory of Everything encourages audiences to give some second thoughts to their common sense of the surrounding world and appreciate the amazement of natureâ€™s laws, their essential simplicity, and the wonder in discovering them.
